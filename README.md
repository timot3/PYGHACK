============= 
**HOME @ PYGHACK.** focuses on real problems within the community. 


We want to explore various factors that may impact poverty levels in Champaign county. In doing so, we identify areas in which more resources need to be allocated to help alleviate the issue.

We also discovered some disturbing truths: 
The Champaign area has one of the highest poverty rates in all of Illinois. 

We trained a random forest classifier on data provided by [Champaign County Regional Planning Comission](https://ccrpc.org/data/?category_name=planning), using cities, towns, and municipalities as data points, and key features such as Average Household Size, Language Most Often Spoken at Home, Mean Travel Time to Work, and Assessed population to generate a model that would identify the most important features that influence the poverty rate.
